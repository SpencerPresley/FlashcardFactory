What type of games have agents with opposite utilities, leading to pure competition, Zero-sum games; What is the term for a sequence of two moves - one by each player - in a two-person game, A ply; In a two-person game - what are the two players often called, MIN and MAX; What does the successor function return in a game problem definition, A list of (move - state) pairs; What does the utility function provide in a game, A numeric value for terminal states; What is the value of a state in adversarial search, The best achievable outcome (utility) from that state; In Minimax search - who maximizes the result and who minimizes it, One player maximizes - the other minimizes; What does the Minimax algorithm compute for each node, The best achievable utility against a rational adversary; What are the two parameters maintained during alpha-beta pruning, Alpha (lower bound) and Beta (upper bound); In alpha-beta pruning - when does alpha change and when does beta change, Alpha changes at max levels - beta changes at min levels; What is the solution to resource limits in game tree search, Depth-limited search; What do evaluation functions score in depth-limited search, Non-terminal positions; What is the ideal function for an evaluation function, Returns the actual minimax value of the position; In practice - what is an evaluation function typically, A weighted linear sum of features; What is the time complexity of Minimax, O(b^m); What is the space complexity of Minimax, O(b*m); What was the first computer chess champion that defeated human champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, Deep Blue; In 2016 - what game did Alpha GO defeat the human champion in, Go; What search method does Alpha GO use, Monte Carlo Tree Search; What are the axes used to categorize different kinds of games, Deterministic or stochastic - One two or more players - Zero sum - Perfect information; What is a solution for a player in a deterministic game, A policy: S -> A; In the recursive Minimax implementation - what is initialized in the min_value function, v = float('inf'); In the recursive Minimax implementation - what is initialized in the max_value function, v = float('-inf'); How does the depth in the tree affect the importance of the evaluation function's quality, The deeper the evaluation function is buried - the less its quality matters; What type of search is Minimax, A state-space search tree;
