What is a heuristic in the context of informed search, A function that estimates how close a state is to a goal; What search strategy expands the node that seems closest to the goal state, Greedy Search; What is the formula for A* search- combining UCS and Greedy, f(n) = g(n) + h(n); What does g(n) represent in the A* search formula, The cost paid so far from the start node to the current node; What does h(n) represent in the A* search formula, The estimated minimum cost from the current node to the destination node; What is an admissible heuristic, A heuristic where h(n) â‰¤ h*(n) - h*(n) being the true cost to the nearest goal; How does Uniform-cost search expand, Equally in all directions; How does A* search expand, Mainly towards the goal - but hedges bets to ensure optimality; What is a key advantage of local search in terms of memory, Very little memory required; What is the main problem with the Hill Climbing algorithm, It can get stuck in local maxima - plateaus - or ridges
